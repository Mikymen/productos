## Project description

The client is a distributor of pharmacy products, he wants to follow the clients products requests in a website and email notification. The clients must be able to enter the system with custom credentials, and from there they will send requests of the selected products.

I followed the client guidelines and as result a made a web app, I use the codeigniter framework for the backend and knockoutjs for the frontend, Its uses customs css styles and boostrap for the design. The database engine its mysql and I have to code stored procedures and views to manage data.
